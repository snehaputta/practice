java program for validating parenthesis:
========================================

A common problem in programming is validating whether the parentheses in an expression are properly balanced. This problem can be solved using a stack data structure. The idea is to iterate through the string and push any opening parentheses onto the stack. For every closing parenthesis, we check if it matches the most recent opening parenthesis (i.e., the one at the top of the stack). If they match, we pop the stack; otherwise, the parentheses are unbalanced. 

Here is a Java program to validate parentheses: 

Java Program to Validate Parentheses 

import java.util.Stack;

public class ParenthesisValidator {

    // Function to check if parentheses are balanced
    public static boolean isValid(String s) {
        // Create a stack to keep track of opening parentheses
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Iterate over each character in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            
            // If it's an opening parenthesis, push it to the stack
            if (currentChar == '(' || currentChar == '{' || currentChar == '[') {
                stack.push(currentChar);
            }
            // If it's a closing parenthesis, check the stack
            else if (currentChar == ')' || currentChar == '}' || currentChar == ']') {
                // If the stack is empty or top of stack doesn't match the closing parenthesis
                if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                    return false;
                }
                char top = stack.pop();
                if (!isMatchingPair(top, currentChar)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If the stack is empty at the end, the parentheses are balanced
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
    
    // Helper function to check if a pair of parentheses match
    public static boolean isMatchingPair(char open, char close) {
        return (open == '(' && close == ')') ||
               (open == '{' && close == '}') ||
               (open == '[' && close == ']');
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        String expression1 = "({[()]})"; // Balanced
        String expression2 = "([)]";     // Not Balanced
        String expression3 = "{[}";      // Not Balanced
        String expression4 = "((()))";   // Balanced
        
        System.out.println("Expression 1: " + isValid(expression1)); // true
        System.out.println("Expression 2: " + isValid(expression2)); // false
        System.out.println("Expression 3: " + isValid(expression3)); // false
        System.out.println("Expression 4: " + isValid(expression4)); // true
    }
}

Explanation:
isValid Method:
This method takes a string of parentheses as input and uses a stack to check if the parentheses are balanced.
It iterates through each character of the string:
If it's an opening parenthesis ('(', '{', '['), it is pushed onto the stack.
If it's a closing parenthesis (')', '}', ']'), it checks if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening parenthesis. If the stack is empty or the parentheses don't match, it returns false.
At the end, if the stack is empty, all the parentheses have been properly matched and closed, so it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
isMatchingPair Method:
This helper method checks if the pair of parentheses (an opening and a closing one) match. It handles all three types: round (), curly {}, and square [].
Test Cases:
"({[()]})": Returns true because all parentheses are properly balanced.
"([)]": Returns false because the parentheses are mismatched.
"{[}": Returns false because the curly bracket is not properly closed.
"((()))": Returns true because the parentheses are balanced.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We go through the string once and perform constant time operations (push and pop) for each character.
Space Complexity: O(n), due to the stack used to store the opening parentheses. In the worst case (if the string consists entirely of opening parentheses), the stack can store n elements.

Java Program For Finding Buildings with an Ocean View:
======================================================

The problem of Finding Buildings with an Ocean View can be solved using a simple approach that leverages a greedy algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the list of building heights, and for each building, check if it has a clear ocean view, meaning no taller building is in front of it.

Problem Explanation:
You are given an array of building heights. The array represents the heights of buildings from left to right. A building has an ocean view if there are no taller buildings in front of it.
The buildings are indexed from left to right, and you can only see the ocean if no other building between the current building and the ocean is taller than the current one.
Approach:
We will iterate through the list of buildings from right to left (reverse order). This allows us to easily track the tallest building encountered so far, which would block the ocean view for any shorter building.
For each building, if its height is greater than or equal to the tallest building seen so far, it has an ocean view. We update the tallest building as needed.
Java Program:
java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class BuildingsWithOceanView {

    // Function to find the buildings with an ocean view
    public static List<Integer> findBuildingsWithOceanView(int[] heights) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int maxHeight = -1; // Variable to track the tallest building encountered so far

        // Iterate through the array from right to left
        for (int i = heights.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (heights[i] > maxHeight) {
                // If the current building is taller than maxHeight, it has an ocean view
                result.add(i);
                maxHeight = heights[i]; // Update the tallest building encountered
            }
        }

        // Reverse the result to return buildings from left to right
        List<Integer> oceanViewBuildings = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = result.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            oceanViewBuildings.add(result.get(i));
        }

        return oceanViewBuildings;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test case
        int[] buildings = {4, 2, 3, 1, 5};
        
        // Find buildings with an ocean view
        List<Integer> buildingsWithOceanView = findBuildingsWithOceanView(buildings);
        
        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Buildings with an ocean view: " + buildingsWithOceanView);
    }
}
Explanation:
findBuildingsWithOceanView Method:

We iterate through the building heights in reverse order (from right to left).
For each building, if its height is greater than the maxHeight (the tallest building encountered so far), it means this building has an ocean view. We then update maxHeight.
The index of each building with an ocean view is stored in the result list.
After finishing the iteration, we reverse the result list to return the building indices in left-to-right order, as that is the typical format for output.
Main Method:

We test the findBuildingsWithOceanView function with a sample array of building heights {4, 2, 3, 1, 5}. The output should be the indices of the buildings that have an ocean view.
Output:
For the test input buildings = {4, 2, 3, 1, 5}, the output will be:

sql
Copy code
Buildings with an ocean view: [0, 2, 4]
This means that the buildings at indices 0, 2, and 4 (with heights 4, 3, and 5, respectively) have ocean views, and the building at index 1 (height 2) does not.

Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of buildings. We only iterate through the list once, and each operation (comparison and insertion into the result list) takes constant time.
Space Complexity: O(n), because in the worst case, all buildings may have an ocean view, and we store their indices in the result list.
Explanation of the Example:
Buildings: {4, 2, 3, 1, 5}
Building 4 (index 0) has a view since there are no buildings to its right.
Building 2 (index 1) doesn't have a view because building 4 (on the left) is taller.
Building 3 (index 2) has a view because no building between index 2 and the ocean is taller than building 3.
Building 1 (index 3) doesn't have a view because building 3 (on the left) is taller.
Building 5 (index 4) has a view because it's taller than all buildings to its left.
Thus, buildings at indices 0, 2, and 4 have an ocean view.

java program trapping rain water:
=================================

The Trapping Rain Water problem involves finding how much water can be trapped between buildings after it rains. The idea is to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped at each position in a series of bars, where each bar's height represents a building. The water trapped at a given position depends on the minimum of the maximum heights of the bars to the left and right of that position, minus the height of the bar at that position itself.

Problem Explanation:
Given an array where each element represents the height of a building/bar.
The objective is to calculate how much water can be trapped between these bars.
Approach:
Two-pointer technique or Dynamic Programming are common methods to solve this problem efficiently.

The Two-pointer approach works by maintaining two pointers, one at the left (left) and one at the right (right), and calculating the water trapped based on the current heights at these positions.
You also maintain two variables left_max and right_max to track the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides, respectively.
Water trapped at each position:

At each position, the trapped water depends on the shorter of the left_max or right_max, subtracting the height of the current building. The formula is:

scss
Copy code
trappedWater = min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]
The idea is to move the pointers inward, adjusting the maximum heights accordingly, and adding the trapped water to the total.

Java Program (Using Two-pointer Approach):
java
Copy code
public class TrappingRainWater {

    // Function to calculate the total water trapped
    public static int trap(int[] height) {
        // Edge case: if there are fewer than 3 bars, no water can be trapped
        if (height == null || height.length < 3) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int left_max = 0, right_max = 0;
        int trappedWater = 0;

        // Two-pointer approach
        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= left_max) {
                    left_max = height[left]; // Update left_max
                } else {
                    trappedWater += left_max - height[left]; // Water trapped at current position
                }
                left++; // Move the left pointer
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= right_max) {
                    right_max = height[right]; // Update right_max
                } else {
                    trappedWater += right_max - height[right]; // Water trapped at current position
                }
                right--; // Move the right pointer
            }
        }

        return trappedWater;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test case
        int[] height = {0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1};
        
        // Calculate the total water trapped
        int result = trap(height);
        
        // Output the result
        System.out.println("Total water trapped: " + result); // Output: 6
    }
}
Explanation of the Code:
Initial Setup:

left: Points to the leftmost index.
right: Points to the rightmost index.
left_max: Tracks the maximum height encountered from the left side.
right_max: Tracks the maximum height encountered from the right side.
trappedWater: Accumulates the total water trapped.
Two-pointer Loop:

The loop continues until the left pointer crosses the right pointer.
If the height at the left pointer is less than or equal to the height at the right pointer:
If the current height at left is greater than or equal to left_max, update left_max.
Otherwise, calculate the trapped water by subtracting the current height from left_max.
Move the left pointer to the right.
If the height at the right pointer is smaller:
If the current height at right is greater than or equal to right_max, update right_max.
Otherwise, calculate the trapped water by subtracting the current height from right_max.
Move the right pointer to the left.
Edge Case:

If there are fewer than 3 bars (less than 3 heights in the array), it's impossible to trap any water, so return 0.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of buildings (elements in the height array). We only make one pass through the array.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables (aside from the input array).
Example:
Given the input heights:

Copy code
{0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1}
The trapped water calculation works as follows:

The total water trapped is 6 units. Specifically, the water can be trapped in the following positions:
At index 2, 1 unit of water can be trapped.
At index 4, 1 unit of water can be trapped.
At index 5, 2 units of water can be trapped.
At index 6, 1 unit of water can be trapped.
At index 8, 1 unit of water can be trapped.
Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Total water trapped: 6
This is a very efficient solution that calculates the amount of water trapped between buildings using a two-pointer approach in linear time.
