Q1: How do you find all `.log` files in the `/var/log` directory that were modified more than 
15 days ago, but exclude those files that are larger than 500MB? 

[Ans]: find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +15 -size -500M

Q2: How can you search for all symbolic links in a directory and delete them using a single 
`find` command? 

[Ans]: find /path/to/directory -type l -exec rm {} +
 
Q3: Using `find`, how do you locate files in the `/home/user` directory that are owned by a 
user other than the current owner? 

[Ans]: find /home/user ! -user $(whoami)

Q4: How can you find all files in the `/etc` directory that contain the word "config" in their 
name and have write permission for others? 
 
[Ans]: find /etc -type f -name "*config*" -perm -002

Q5: How can you search for all lines in a file `/etc/passwd` that do not contain the word 
"bash"? 

[Ans]: grep -v "bash" /etc/passwd
 
Q6: How do you search recursively through all files in a directory for a specific string, showing 
only the matching filenames and excluding binary files? 

[Ans]: grep -rl --exclude-binary "your_string" /path/to/directory
 
Q7: How can you search for the word "error" in a file, displaying the surrounding 3 lines 
before and after each match? 

[Ans]: grep -C 3 "error" logfile.log
 
Q8: Using `grep`, how would you find all occurrences of the word "root" in `/etc/passwd` that 
start at the beginning of a line? 

[Ans]: grep "^root" /etc/passwd
 
Q9: How can you create a compressed archive of the `/home/user` directory, excluding all 
`.mp4` files? 

[Ans]: tar --exclude='*.mp4' -czvf user_archive.tar.gz -C /home user
 
Q10: How would you extract only a specific file `file.txt` from a `.tar.gz` archive without 
extracting the entire archive? 

[Ans]: tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz file.txt
 
Q11: How can you append a file called `newfile.txt` to an existing `archive.tar.gz` without 
decompressing the archive? 

[Ans]: To append a file called `newfile.txt` to an existing `archive.tar.gz` without decompressing the archive, you can use the `tar` command 
with the `--append` (`-r`) option. However, since `tar` cannot directly append to compressed archives, you first need to extract it, append the file, 
and then compress it again. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Extract the existing archive:**

   ```bash
   mkdir temp_dir
   tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz -C temp_dir
   ```

2. **Append the new file to the extracted contents:**

   ```bash
   cp newfile.txt temp_dir/
   ```

3. **Recreate the `.tar.gz` archive with the new file:**

   ```bash
   tar -czvf archive.tar.gz -C temp_dir .
   ```

4. **Clean up the temporary directory:**

   ```bash
   rm -r temp_dir
   ```

### Note:
As a direct method, you can't append to a compressed `.tar.gz` file without decompressing it first.
This is the typical approach to achieve the desired outcome. If you frequently need to append files, 
consider keeping the archive in an uncompressed format (like `.tar`) until you're done appending.
 
Q12: How would you list the contents of a `.tar.gz` archive without extracting it? 

[Ans]: tar -tzvf archive.tar.gz

Q13: How can you list all currently running processes and then filter for processes that 
include the word "java", showing only the process ID and name? 

[Ans]: ps aux | grep "java" | awk '{print $2, $11}'
 
Q14: How can you display a list of all files in `/var/log`, then filter for files containing the word 
"error" using both `ls` and `grep` in a pipeline? 

[Ans]: ls /var/log | grep "error"
 
Q15: How do you count the number of lines in a file that contain the word "failed" using 
`grep` and `wc`? 

[Ans]: grep -c "failed" filename or grep "failed" filename | wc -l
 
Q16: How can you display the last 20 lines of a log file and filter the lines that contain the 
word "critical" using a combination of `tail` and `grep`? 

[Ans]: tail -n 20 logfile | grep "critical"
 
Q17: How do you display the disk usage of all files and directories in `/home/user` in humanreadable format, sorted by size in descending order? 

[Ans]: descending order: du -h /home/user | sort -hr

       ascending order: du -h /home/user | sort -h
 
Q18: How can you display the total disk usage of the `/var` directory but exclude the 
subdirectory `/var/log`? 

[Ans]: du -sh /var --exclude=/var/log
 
Q19: How can you use `du` to find the disk usage of files larger than 100MB in a directory? 

[Ans]: find /path/to/directory -type f -size +100M -exec du -h {} +
 
Q20: How do you display the disk usage of the 10 largest directories in the `/usr` directory 
using `du`? 

[Ans]: du -h --max-depth=1 /usr | sort -hr | head -n 10
